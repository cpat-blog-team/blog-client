# CPAT blog client
The front end for a blogging web app to foster growth amongst the IBM CPAT team via the sharing of information. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Note: This App uses IBM App ID for authentication.

<!-- ### For running the app without authentication:
  1. Clone this repository to your local machine 
  2. Run "cd blog-client" to move into the repository
  3. Run "npm install" to install the project's dependencies
  4. Run "npm run dev-no-auth" and wait a minute until you see a file called bundle.js appear at location cpat-blog/public/bundle.js
  5. Once the bundle.js file has been compiled you can open a browser and head to http://localhost:3001/ 
  6. You can now make changes to the source code and webpack will rebuild your bundle for you, just wait for the new bundle to be compiled and refresh you browser to see the changes. -->
